App Details: A simple app built with React + NextJS for users to test and improve their typing skills. The app presents the user with a random text paragraph and the time duration of the typing test which is 1min. Once the test is set up, the user starts the test and hence the timer. The user types the paragraph in another text box as it is. For each correct word, he gets 1 point and for each incorrect word, he types he will receive a wrong point. Total points are the total no of characters in the paragraph.


## To build
1.  Clone the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/demolaemrick/nextjs-mui-typescript-starter.git
```
2.  Change into the project directory you'd like to run:
```bash
cd <name-of-your-directory>
```
4.  Install the dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

## Getting Started
Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
